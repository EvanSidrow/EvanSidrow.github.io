I am a Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellow in Statistics at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci.html) under the supervision of [Lloyd Elliott](https://www.sfu.ca/stat-actsci/department/profiles/lloyd-elliott.html) and [Junling Ma](https://www.uvic.ca/science/math-statistics/people/home/faculty/ma_junling.php). I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) in 2024 under the supervison of [Nancy Heckman](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/nancy-e-heckman) and [Marie Auger-Méthé](https://statisticalecology.weebly.com/). I also completed my M.S. and B.S in Applied Mathematics at the [University of Colorado](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/) in 2018 under the supervision of [Jem Corcoran](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/corcoran/).

Outside of work, I like to spend my time running, rock climbing, snowboarding, and otherwise enjoying the outdoors.

Research Interests
======

I am interested in doubly stochastic processes (hidden Markov models, state-space models, etc.) to analyze large and complex datasets, particuarly in ecology. During my PhD, I focused on modelling and fitting hidden Markov models to identify hunting behaviours in killer whales, and I am currently working to integrate deep learning techniques into this framework.

I also have a strong interest in Bayesian inference over network structures such as phyologenetic trees and Bayesian networks. I am currently focused on Bayesian phylogentic inference. Previously, [Jem Corcoran](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/corcoran/) and I designed an MCMC algorithm to sample Bayesian networks from categorical data.

Professional Background
======

Before attending UBC, I worked as a data scientist at [Seagate Technology](https://www.seagate.com/ca/en/). There, I developed applications to query multiple databases and run machine learning algorithms (e.g., random forests, autoencoders, LSTMs) to automatically detect faults in the hard drive production process. I also worked as a data science intern at [Code42](https://www.code42.com/) to detect anomalies in IP address data.
