excerpt: 'With attention turned to Europa as a target for exploration, we focus on the space environment in which Europa is embedded. We review remote and in situ observations of plasma properties at Europa’s orbit, between Io’s dense, UV-emitting plasma torus and Jupiter’s dynamic plasma sheet. Where observations are limited (e.g. in plasma composition), we supplement our analysis with models of the neutral and plasma populations from Io to Europa. We evaluate variations and uncertainties in plasma properties with radial distance, latitude, longitude and time.'
